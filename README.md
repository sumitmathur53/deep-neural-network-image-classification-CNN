Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are:

    Convolutional layer
    Pooling layer
    Fully-connected (FC) layer

The convolutional layer is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or pooling layers, the fully-connected layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object.

###   CIFAR-10 Dataset as it suggests has 10 different categories of images in it. There is a total of 60000 images of 10 different classes naming Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck. All the images are of size 32Ã—32. There are in total 50000 train images and 10000 test images.

To build an image classifier we make use of tensorflow's keras API to build our model.
